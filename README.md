## Hi there üëã
 I'm Shahmeer Khan, a final year Computer Science at the University of Liverpool with a passion for building innovative, practical software. My journey in software engineering has been an exciting mis of academic learning, hands-on projects, and personal growth all steering me torward my dream of working as a software engineer in the U.S. 

## My Journey in Software Engineering üìò
As part of my Bachelor's degree, I've worked on a range of projects that developed my technical skills and deepened my understanding of software engineer. Some of the highlights include: 

  - **To Do List Application (Java, Swing)**: My first substantial project in Java, focusing on basic CRUD           operations and user interfaces.
    
  - **Coursework Calendar (MERN Stack)**: A web application designed to help university students manage              deadlines. I worked primarily on designing and polishing the user interfaces and other frontend 
      related development. This project is being funded and supervised by the Department of Electrical 
      Engineering & Electronics within the University of Liverpool.
    
  - **Data Analytics with PySpark (Python, PySpark)**: Recently, I've been working on analysing GPS trajectory data sets using PySparkm which has strengthened my data processing skills and introduced me to big data concepts.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
Here's a quick overview of the technologies I use daily: 
  - **Languages**: Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript
  - **Frameworks & Libraries**: Node.js, Express, Reach, PySpark
